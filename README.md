# TicTacToe
The well-known little game Tic Tac Toe as a browser game. (Currently only tested in the Browser ***Edge***)

I think there's not much to say. 
I wrote this just for fun to try it out if it would be complicated 
and found out that it's not too complex. 
Still, the code is pretty bloated and could be refactored 
(especially the *function **checkGameState*** with those many ***if***'s)
to safely save a few lines of code. But there are other priorities these days.

I am sure this script will save the world :grinning:
