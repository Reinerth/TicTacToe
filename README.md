The well-known little game Tic Tac Toe as a browser game. (Currently only tested in Edge)

I think there's not much to say. 
I wrote this just for fun to try it out if it would be complicated 
and found out that it's not too complex. 
Still, the code is pretty bloated and could be refactored 
to safely save a few lines of code. But there are other priorities these days.
